# Track and Trigger

Nowadays, due to hectic work schedules, it is quite difficult to remember as well as manage the availability of mandatory commodities in an urban home.

Thereby, we have put in efforts in developing an automated <u>android application</u> (completely in **JAVA**) in order to keep track of the regular activities and aid people in managing the daily home inventories.

## Android Requirements:

minSDK Version 28, Target SDK Version 30
(Tested on Android-10)

## Flow of our Application

We have provided the following three functionalities for verification & login:- <br />

- via Email <br />
- via Phone number <br />
- via Google <br />

## Dashboard

After logging in by any of the 3 ways above, we will navigate to the Dashboard screen. In the dashboard, the user can add and customize lists according to his/her needs and preferences. User can customise the background and the icon of the list as he desires.

## Adding items to a list

The user can add tasks or notes in any particular list and set reminder for that task
at any particular time. The tasks which are scheduled for today would be shown in red color and those scheduled for tomorrow would be shown in orange color. Any other tasks would be shown in (default) white color. Once completed, the user can mark the task as done. Also the user can star any task i.e. mark it as important.

## Reminders

The user would receive reminders through email and mobile notification at the desired time.

## Prioritize tasks

The app offers three automated lists for better and quicker management.

- Today - Shows you all the tasks that are due today.
- Tomorrow - Shows you all the tasks that are due tomorrow.
- Important - Shows all the tasks that you've marked as important and are still pending.

| Today's tasks          | Tomorrow's tasks          | Important tasks            | -->
